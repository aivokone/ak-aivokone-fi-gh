## Git Workflow

For commit, push, PR creation, code review, and fix reporting related tasks, see git-workflow.md:
- If you can, import @.docs/workflows/git-workflow.md
- If not succesful, try to read [docs/workflows/git-workflow.md](docs/workflows/git-workflow.md)
- If failed, stop and report

That document is the source of truth for:
- commit/push rules (QUICK vs SAFE)
- PR creation and template
- review policy (top-level comments only)
- how to read feedback (including inline comments from external bots)
- fix reporting and re-review loop
